# Todo

## Project Structure and Architecture

- Plan the overall structure of your project.
- Define the architecture, folder structure, and how different components will interact.

## Set Up the Backend

- Initialize a new Rust project using `cargo`.
- Set up Actix or Actix-web for your backend application.
- Configure the PostgreSQL database connection.
- Implement basic API endpoints or GraphQL schemas.

## Set Up the Frontend

- Initialize a new TypeScript project using `create-react-app` or a similar tool.
- Set up React and configure your project structure.
- Begin building UI components based on your design.

## Integration with GraphQL

- Implement GraphQL schemas and resolvers on the backend.
- Integrate GraphQL queries and mutations in your TypeScript frontend using a GraphQL client library (e.g., Apollo Client).

## Authentication and Authorization

- Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
- Set up authorization mechanisms to control access to certain parts of your application.

## Database Schema and Models

- Define the database schema for your application.
- Create models in Rust to interact with the database using an ORM or similar tool.

## User Interface and Experience

- Continue developing UI components for a seamless user experience.
- Implement features like transaction recording, budget planning, and other financial management functionalities.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for your Rust backend and TypeScript frontend code.
- Implement end-to-end tests using tools like Jest and Cypress.

## Documentation

- Document your API using Swagger or other appropriate tools.
- Create documentation for your Rust backend and TypeScript frontend code.
- Ensure that your project README is informative and provides guidance on setting up and running the application.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.
- Deploy your application locally in your Docker environment.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement monitoring solutions for your application (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- Ensure that logs are appropriately handled and stored using Serilog.

## User Testing

- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on your application's usability and functionality.
- Iterate on your application based on user feedback.
