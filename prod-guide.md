# Project Structure and Architecture Guide

## 1. Project Overview

- Define the primary goals and objectives of your financial management application.
- Identify key features, user personas, and any regulatory considerations.

## 2. Architecture Decision

- Choose an architectural pattern that aligns with your project requirements. Common patterns include
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller) Separation of concerns with distinct layers for data, presentation, and user interaction.
  - Microservices Divide the application into small, independent services.
  - Layered (Three-Tier or N-Tier) Segregate functionalities into layers like presentation, business logic, and data storage.

## 3. Folder Structure

- Organize your project into logical folders to enhance maintainability.
- Example folder structure for a Rust backend and TypeScript frontend

    backend/
        src/
            controllers/
            models/
            services/
            routes/
        migrations/
        tests/
    frontend/
        public/
        src/
            components/
            containers/
            services/
            styles/
        tests/

## 4. Components Interaction

- Define how different components will communicate and interact.
- Identify key interfaces and contracts between modules.

## 5. Dependency Management

- Choose a dependency management approach suitable for your language and framework.
- In Rust, use `Cargo.toml` for managing dependencies.
- In TypeScript, use `package.json` and `yarn` or `npm`.

## 6. Configuration Management

- Separate configuration settings for different environments (development, testing, production).
- Utilize configuration files or environment variables.

## 7. Version Control

- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking changes.
- Decide on branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow) and commit message conventions.

## 8. Code Style and Standards

- Establish coding conventions and style guides for consistency.
- Use linters and formatters to automate code styling.

## 9. Documentation

- Create documentation for your project, including architecture diagrams, API documentation, and contribution guidelines.
- Utilize tools like Swagger for API documentation.

## 10. Collaboration Tools

- Set up collaboration tools like Jira for project management, communication tools (e.g., Slack), and a knowledge repository (e.g., Confluence).

## 11. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD processes.

## 12. Security Considerations

- Identify potential security risks and implement best practices.
- Regularly update dependencies and conduct security audits.

## 13. Scalability Considerations

- Design your application with scalability in mind.
- Consider load balancing, caching strategies, and database sharding if needed.

## 14. Monitoring and Logging

- Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for tracking application performance.
- Set up logging mechanisms (e.g., Serilog) for debugging and auditing.

## 15. Testing Strategy

- Define a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Use tools like Jest for TypeScript testing and built-in Rust testing features.

Remember to revisit and iterate on your architecture as the project evolves. Flexibility and adaptability are key to long-term success. If you have specific questions or need further guidance on any aspect, feel free to ask!
